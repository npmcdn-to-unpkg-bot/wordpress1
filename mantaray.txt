designing issue :-

Menu issue feedback:-
 As it is right now, there is a very small area where the mouse over drop down shows, I have trouble when I move my mouse down onto the list of links because they disappear unless my cursor is in the right place over the main menu item. It should drop down on mouse over and when the cursor moves downwards, the list of links should stay visible until the cursor moves above the main menu link, to the right or left of the main menu link vertical edges or below the list of links. The drop down should be 100% width of the main menu item's left edge of the top dark blue text link.
